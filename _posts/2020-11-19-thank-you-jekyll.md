After many years I decided to blogging again. Really I don’t like use [Wordpress] blog so I have decided to choice [Jekyll]. Jekyll is very different to Wordpress and requires a completely different skill set to implement. It is easy enough to pickup if you have a good understanding of IT but probably not a simple job if you don’t.

At the moment I am using [Visual Studio Code] on my MacBook for content editing and testing changes by running Jekyll locally.

This site is currently using the custom theme based on pudhina theme. This theme is relatively basic and minimal compared to many Wordpress themes but has the functionality I need for this blog while still offering a degree of customization. I truly love minimal theme.

So far I am enjoying learning Jekyll and will aim to carry on developing this site, though I can’t guarantee I won’t get bored with it as I have done many times in the past. We’ll have to wait and see.
