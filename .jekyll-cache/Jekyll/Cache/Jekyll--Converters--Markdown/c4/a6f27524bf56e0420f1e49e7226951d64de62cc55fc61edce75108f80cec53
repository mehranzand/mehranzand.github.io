I"=<p>After many years I decided to blogging again. Really I don’t like use <a href="http://wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> blog so I have decided to choice <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. Jekyll is very different to Wordpress and requires a completely different skill set to implement. It is easy enough to pickup if you have a good understanding of IT but probably not a simple job if you don’t.</p>

<p>At the moment I am using <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> on my MacBook for content editing and testing changes by running Jekyll locally.</p>

<p>This site is currently using the custom theme based on pudhina theme. This theme is relatively basic and minimal compared to many Wordpress themes but has the functionality I need for this blog while still offering a degree of customization. I truly love minimal theme.</p>

<p>So far I am enjoying learning Jekyll and will aim to carry on developing this site, though I can’t guarantee I won’t get bored with it as I have done many times in the past. We’ll have to wait and see.</p>
